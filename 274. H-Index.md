Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

&emsp;...嗯感觉有三个层次...
nlgn+n -> nlgn + lgn -> 2n

&emsp;最弱的层次..通过排序来搞定(优化就是二分)，最优就是通过桶排序来搞!

```
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        
        if(citations.length == 0)return 0;
        if(citations.length == 1)return citations[0] == 0 ? 0 : 1;
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        int i = 0;
        while(i < citations.length){
            if(i+1 < citations[citations.length - 1 - i])i++;
            else if(i+1 == citations[citations.length - 1 - i])return i+1;
            else return i;
        }
        return i;
    }
}
```

```
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
 
        int l = citations.length;
        int[] bucket = new int[l+1];
        Arrays.fill(bucket,0);
        for(int i : citations){
            if(i > l)bucket[l]++;
            else bucket[i]++;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = l; i >= 0 ; i--){
            count += bucket[i];
            if(count >= i)return i;
        }
        
        return 0;
        
    }
}
