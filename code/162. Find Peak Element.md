A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array where num[i] ≠ num[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

You may imagine that num[-1] = num[n] = -∞.

For example, in array [1, 2, 3, 1], 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Note:\
Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.

&emsp;核心是,理解**num[-1] = num[n] = -∞**的意义!就是说,序列递增,那么最右边的是peak,序列递减,那么最左边的是peak!这个很重要,才能基于序列做二分!

```
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        //bound 
        if(nums.length == 0)return -1;
        int l = 0;
        int h = nums.length - 1;
        while(l < h){
            int mid = l + (h - l)/2;
            if(nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]) l = mid + 1;
            else h = mid;
        }
        return h;
    }
}
```
