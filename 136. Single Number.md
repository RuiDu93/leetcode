Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

简单的异或思路
```
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        
        int ret = 0;
        for(int i : nums)ret^=i;
        return ret;
        
    }
}
```
