Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.

You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)

Return the maximum profit you can make.

Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
Buying at prices[0] = 1
Selling at prices[3] = 8
Buying at prices[4] = 4
Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```
Note:
```
0 < prices.length <= 50000.
0 < prices[i] < 50000.
0 <= fee < 50000.
```

        int[] hold = new int[l + 1]; //Hold the stock until day i;
        int[] notHold = new int[l + 1]; //Do not hold the stock until day i;
        hold[0] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= l; i++) {
            hold[i] = Math.max(hold[i - 1], notHold[i - 1] - prices[i - 1] - fee);
            notHold[i] = Math.max(notHold[i - 1], hold[i - 1] + prices[i - 1]);
        }
        
        return notHold[l];
    }
}
