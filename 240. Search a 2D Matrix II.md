Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
For example,

Consider the following matrix:
```
[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
```
Given target = 5, return true.

Given target = 20, return false.

&emsp;二分,核心就是找到切入点!
```
class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {

        int h = matrix.length;
        if(h == 0)return false;
        int w = matrix[0].length;
        
        int i = h - 1;
        int j = 0;
        
        while(i>=0 && j < w){
            if(matrix[i][j] == target)return true;
            if(matrix[i][j] > target){
                i--;
            }else{
                j++;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```
